                        <p>
                            Good Business needs to gather and use certain information about
                            individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These individuals can include customers, suppliers, business
                            contacts, and other people we have arelationship with or may need
                            to contact, as well as you as employees.{" "}

                        <p>
                            Good Business is committed to being transparent about how it
                            collects and uses the personal data of its workforce, and to
                            meeting its data protection obligations. This policy sets out our
                            commitment to data protection, and individual rights and
                            obligations in relation to personal data.

                        <p>
                            It describes how this personal data must be collected, handled and
                            stored to meet our data protection standards — and to comply with
                            the law. It is important that you understand the policy and how it
                            applies to you, and that you implement the policy whenever you
                            gather, use or store information about people.

                        <p>

                            example if the request is particularly complex) we will notify

                            to comply with it. Alternatively, we can agree to respond but will
                            charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost of
